// This contract is a crowdsale based on Zeppelin's Crowdsale.sol but with
// several changes:
//   * the token contract as well as the supply contract get injected
//     with setTokenContract() and setSupplyContract()
//   * we have a dynamic token supply per day which we hold in the statsByDay
//   * once per day, the *updater* role runs the update function to make the
//     contract read the new supply and switch to the next day
//   * we have a minimum amount in ETH per transaction
//   * we have a maximum amount per transaction relative to the daily supply
//
